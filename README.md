**GTAVTool** is a utility designed to enhance your gaming experience in *Grand Theft Auto V (GTAV)*. It facilitates the replay of heist missions by blocking communication between the game client and the Rockstar Game server at the end of a heist. This allows players to replay heists and still receive the in-game currency rewards.
