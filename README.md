GTAVTool is a utility designed to enhance your gaming experience in Grand Theft Auto V (GTAV). It facilitates the replay of heist missions by blocking communication between the game client and the Rockstar Game server at the end of a heist. This allows players to replay heists and still receive the in-game currency rewards.

## Features

- **Toggle Communication**: Block the communication with GTAV Server (used for heist).
- **Display Status Overlay**: Activate/Deactivate the overlay with communication status.
- **Close GTAV**: Immediately close the game (used for casino wheel).

## How It Works

GTAVTool operates by intercepting communication between the game client and the Rockstar Game server. At the conclusion of a heist mission, it blocks the transmission of data to the server, allowing the game to treat the heist as if it were not completed. This enables players to replay the heist while retaining the associated rewards.

## Usage

1. **Download**: Download the GTAVTool from the [release](https://github.com/Aarplexan/gtavtool/releases/download/v1.0.0/GTAVTool.zip).
2. **Installation**: Unzip the files in a folder and start GTAVTool.exe in Administrator.
3. **Activation**: Toggle the communication GTAVTool before starting a heist mission in GTAV.
4. **Replay**: Upon completion of a heist mission, GTAVTool will block communication with the server, allowing for replay without losing rewards.
5. **Shortcut**: Use **LCTRL + F1** to toggle on/off the communication with rockstar game server.
