GTAVTool is a utility designed to enhance your gaming experience in Grand Theft Auto V (GTAV). It facilitates the replay of heist missions by blocking communication between the game client and the Rockstar Game server at the end of a heist. This allows players to replay heists and still receive the in-game currency rewards.

## Features

- **Toggle Communication**: Block the communication with GTAV Server (used for heist).
- **Display Status Overlay**: Activate/Deactivate the overlay with communication status.
- **Close GTAV**: Immediately close the game (used for casino wheel).
- **Shortcut**: You can use **LCTRL + F1** to toggle on/off the communication with GTAV Server.
